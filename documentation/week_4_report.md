# Week 4 report

This week I have finalized the core functions within my program, but my main focus has been on performance testing. I had never done any performance testing before so I had to research the subject to begin with. I got the jist that the main thing is examining how fast ones program is, but that there are other aspects as well, like  stability and reliabilty. I first used Cprofile which gives alot of nice information about various aspects like how many times a function is called, how many recursive calls and much more. At the end I still wanted to be able to visualize the information in a clear and effective manner which lead me to create my own testing program which ofcourse is much simpler than Cprofile, but does what it is supposed to do (meassure the time-performance) and visualizes it as a graph, where we can see the best, worst and average performance of a set of code. In [testing document](./testing_document.md) you can read more specifics about how I went about performance testing my code.
