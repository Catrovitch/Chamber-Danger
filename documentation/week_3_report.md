# Week 3

This week I pretty much started my project from srcatch after talking with the course instructor who told me that I should reconsider what algorithms I was using. I decided to stick to my subject of a dungeon generator, but I am now using different techniques to achieve the results. I am doing the generator so that I am using a BSP algorithm for room placement and then one can choose a method of connecting the rooms. Currently I have implemented two versions where the first version produces straight corridors between the rooms and the second version uses a different algorithm called the drunkard's walk to produce less straight corridors with a more organic look. I have also written tests for most of the classes.
