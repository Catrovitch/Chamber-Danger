# Week 5 report

This week I have peer reviewed a project, developed more extensive testing and improved on the core functionality of the program. I also experienced major technical issues concerning various packages used which ate up a lot of time. This was due to me switching computers and having to reinstall various packages which I apperently didn't go about correctly.
