# Week 5 report

This week I have peer reviewed a project, developed more extensive testing and improved on the core functionality of the program. I also experienced major technical issues concerning various packages used which ate up a lot of time. This was due to me switching computers and having to reinstall various packages which I apperently didn't go about correctly. 


## Peer review

Reviewing a peer's was a really rewarding experience as the project I was reviewing was really well done. The structure was good and the code was clear and superbly documented. I gave me a good look at a project which I could learn from. Sadly this also meant that there wasn't that much for me to critisize or suggest improvements on which was a central part for getting point for the peer review. 

## Issues

I swtiched computers and had to reinstall lots of packages which lead to me having lots of problems. For some reason my poetry suddenly stopped working entirely. Though I have installed it accordning to instructions it still can't be found on my computer. At the end I decided to use my old computer to get everything done.

## Time spent on course this week:
