# Week 1 report

As this week was the first week of the course much of the time spent has gone into familirising with the course material, researching various subjects and deciding on what subject I want to focus my project on. During spring in the Ohjelmointitekniikka course I chose a somewhat to ambitious project so for this course I have decided to start small and focus on very good quality above the scale of the project. I am very interesting in game development and especially the dungeon/maze generator subject seemed very interesting to me, so I pretty quickly decided that was what I'm going to do. It wasn't ofcourse that simple since there are tons of different ways to randomly generate mazes or dungeons. In the instructions it said that simple maze generation is usually so straight forward that for this course it would be suitable to compare two different methods. This didn't really speak to me as I rather want to make one bigger program than comparing two smaller ones. I seattled on creating a dungeon generator that will generate chambers and then connect them with corridors. This seemed like a project which is quite simple to begin with, but can be expanded upon if time allows it and also more interesting than comparing two very simple algorithms. What I found hard this week was first and foremost deciding on the project subject. There are so mangy interesting subjects, so which to chose? And then further, what sort of maze/dungeon generator do I want to create. Secondly I also had to refresh my memory on some of the algorithms and principles introduced during Tira 1 & 2. Well finally I decided on the subject and the specific kind of algorithm I would be using. The only problem that remained was knowing exactly what the time complexity of the algorithm would be. This will probably get clearer when I actually start programming it. The natural next step will be to start detailing how the program will work. All and all I look forward to doing this course as I think it's my favourite kind of course, since it allows for creative freedom as well as the format being very free (no precise hours or mandatory precense (besides the demonstration)).

Hours spent this week: about 12-13 hours.
